### **About me**

I am a final year student at Management Development Institute of Singapore in Tashkent. I have experience in international procurement processes through the work done at Meros Pharm, one of Uzbekistan's largest pharmaceutical companies. 
I am always eager to gain new knowledge and develop my technical and soft skills, thus open to new challenges and adventures. Recently, after having made a small research about computer programming, I became very interested in this field, therefore decided to dive into it. I signed up for the RS School basic course on JS/Front-End, and for now, it has become the first step of my amazing programming journey. Let's see where it will eventually take us! ;)
